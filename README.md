# Do-Track | Web-based Attendance Management System 📊🚀

The conventional method of collecting attendance at Caraga State University involves pen and paper, requiring students to list their names, program details, and provide a signature. This practice is observed by the College of Computing and Information Sciences Local Student Government and other Local Government Organizations, functioning as subordinate bodies within the CSU University Student Government (CSU-USG).

## 1.2 Problem Identification

### 1. Student Population Disparities 📊
Managing attendees on Do-days faces challenges due to varying student populations across different colleges. The College of Computing and Information Sciences at Caraga State University has the highest enrollment, complicating the task of monitoring and managing participants efficiently.

### 2. Hours Tracking Dilemma ⏰
Accurate tracking of rendered hours per student is a significant obstacle. Deviations from stipulated hours result in administration errors, such as mistakenly blocking a student who contributed hours but wasn't recorded in the attendance system.

### 3. Outdated Attendance Recording System 📜
Relying on a traditional, paper-based attendance recording system introduces issues, including potential loss of attendee lists. Manual paperwork inefficiencies undermine the overall effectiveness of the attendance management process.

### 4. Overburdened Office Operations 🏢
The Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Services (OVPSAS) struggles with handling student attendance for university-wide activities. The responsibility of general blocking and unblocking of students burdens the staff, limiting efficiency. An outdated university-developed system further compounds these challenges.

## 1.3 Solution

The **Do-Track Attendance System** is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify and enhance the tracking of student participation in cleaning drives within educational institutions. This system efficiently manages student attendance during designated "Do-days," where students actively engage in cleaning activities to contribute to a cleaner and more organized environment.
